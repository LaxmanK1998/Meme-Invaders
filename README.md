## A funny remake of the classic Space invaders :)

Created by looking at the walkthrough by Attreya Bhatt on Freecodecamp YouTube channel.
Modifications done by me. Thank you Attreya for helping me develop this simple game.
I look to modifying this project and adding new things to it in the future.
